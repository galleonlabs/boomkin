# Contributing to Boomkin

Bug reports, documentation improvements, provider fixes and focused pull requests are welcome. You do not need a funded wallet or a paid model account to work on Boomkin.

## Find the right home

Boomkin owns onboarding, profiles, provider discovery, research projects and verified skill installation. Protocol procedures belong in [crypto-defi-skills](https://github.com/galleonlabs/crypto-defi-skills); Hermes owns the agent loop, model adapters, memory and scheduling. Agents can use [the documentation index](docs/AGENT-INDEX.md) and [repository routing](AGENTS.md) to find the owning files.

For a larger addition, open an issue describing the user need and proposed scope. Small fixes and clearer documentation can go straight to a pull request.

## Work locally

Use Bun 1.3.12 and Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/galleonlabs/boomkin.git
cd boomkin
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run check
bun run build
```

| Change | Additional validation |
| --- | --- |
| Installer, catalog or harness adapter | `bun run smoke` checks fresh installs, updates and independent pack selection. Pull requests that touch those paths run the same Harness compatibility job |
| Catalog pin authenticity | `bun scripts/catalog-freshness.ts --verify` checks each pin against upstream `galleon-*-skills@*` release tags. Pull requests that touch `catalog/**` run this job |
| Native Hermes integration | `python3 scripts/hermes-native-smoke.py --hermes /absolute/path/to/hermes`; CI exercises the reviewed runtime |
| Local desk | `bun run build`; `bun run boomkin desk --no-open --directory /absolute/test/profile`; inspect first use, all three jobs, sources, exports, cancel/restart and desktop/mobile behavior |
| Documentation or website | Check commands against `bun run boomkin --help`; run `bun run build:site` and `bun run check:site` for rendered guides and links |
| Public website interaction | Inspect affected desktop/mobile views, search or lab controls, browser errors and exact public serving revision; see [WEBSITE.md](docs/WEBSITE.md) |

The native smoke uses a temporary profile and local mock MCP. Its optional `--public` flag adds keyless CoinGecko discovery. Validation must not authenticate paid services, call a model, create a wallet or submit a financial action.

## Add or update a skill pack

Update [catalog/skills.json](catalog/skills.json) with the published npm identity and version, immutable monorepo source revision, package path and expected skills. Follow the existing entries, including the foundation packs' distinct package and skill names.

A catalog pin change is verified by two pull-request checks. Harness compatibility runs `bun run smoke` against the proposed catalog; a mis-pinned version, nonexistent revision, or skill list that does not match the installed set fails the pull request rather than a consumer's `boomkin update`. Catalog freshness `--verify` additionally requires each pinned `(package, version)` to be a published upstream release tag whose commit equals the pinned revision. Confirm the public release exists. A newer upstream tag is reported by the scheduled freshness job; it does not rewrite the catalog. Repinning remains a reviewed change. Packs need an open-source license, valid Agent Skills files, self-contained references, documented prerequisites and explicit limits on financial actions. Keep each pack independently selectable.

## Add a provider or harness

Reuse official tools and native authentication. Document the primary source, supported versions, configuration location and permission scope. For a harness adapter, include its upstream installer agent ID and verified discovery directory.

Provider discovery can describe a sourced tool without making it a native connection. Keep [catalog/providers.json](catalog/providers.json), [provider guidance](docs/PROVIDERS.md) and [connection scope](docs/CONNECTIONS.md) aligned. Record authorship, review date, cost and authority independently; a keyless endpoint can still be paid.

Use fixtures or temporary profiles to exercise failures without real credentials. Preserve user instructions and unrelated settings. File installation, tool discovery, authenticated access and transaction execution are different outcomes; report only what the checks establish.

## Send a pull request

Describe the user-visible change, why it is needed and the checks you ran. For a bug, include a small reproduction and expected behavior. Add regression coverage when behavior or a failure boundary changes; documentation fixes need proportionate checks.

Keep secrets, private profiles and generated artifacts out of commits. Report vulnerabilities through the [security policy](SECURITY.md), rather than a public issue.
