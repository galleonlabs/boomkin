# Updates and recovery

Keep Boomkin, its skill packs and the Hermes runtime up to date separately. Use the same profile directory you chose during onboarding.

[Onboarding](../README.md#get-started) · [Connections](CONNECTIONS.md) · [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Everyday updates

From your Boomkin checkout:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run boomkin check --directory "$HOME/.boomkin/hermes"
bun run boomkin update --directory "$HOME/.boomkin/hermes"
bun run boomkin doctor --live
bun run boomkin start
```

Replace the directory above if you use another profile, and pass it to `doctor` and `start` too. Back up customized skill files before updating; the upstream installer can replace them. Restart an active Hermes session to load changed instructions and tools.

| Component | How it updates |
| --- | --- |
| Boomkin CLI and guides | Pull this repository and install its locked dependencies |
| Selected skill packs | Run `boomkin update` against the chosen profile |
| Hermes runtime | Use Hermes's native update procedure, then rerun `doctor --live` |
| Provider credentials and tools | Use the native setup paths in the [connection guide](CONNECTIONS.md) |

`doctor` checks configuration; `--live` also checks public CoinGecko tool discovery and credential-free AIXBT discovery when that optional connection is configured. Confirm a successful first task through Hermes before relying on the updated setup. These checks do not establish wallet or trading authority.

## Select your packs

Fresh onboarding includes every pack in the checked-out catalog. Updates preserve the saved selection, and new catalog packs are opt-in for existing profiles. Use repeated `--pack` options to set the full desired selection:

```bash
bun run boomkin update --directory "$HOME/.boomkin/hermes" \
  --pack defi-infra-skills --pack defi-data-skills
```

Deselected pack files are preserved so that local edits are not deleted. To include every pack currently in Boomkin's checked-out catalog:

```bash
bun run boomkin onboard --directory "$HOME/.boomkin/hermes" --all-packs
```

Onboarding preserves existing SOUL and instruction files. It opens native model setup unless you pass `--skip-model-setup`. Configurations written before pack selection was recorded retain LP and Hyperliquid until you explicitly expand them.

## Verified releases

Boomkin 0.6.3 pins all 14 packs to the [September 9 upstream release](https://github.com/galleonlabs/crypto-defi-skills/commit/d5d8439bd5bd1fec88994a6ca0448cde11e31747). These releases add configurable workflow guidance and task examples, including Hyperliquid planning preferences and monitoring stream discipline. The catalog still contains 26 skills; existing pack selections, profile instructions and native Hermes configuration are preserved. Update selected packs with the commands above.

Boomkin 0.6.2 pins Security 0.2.1, Liquidity provision 0.5.1, Routing 0.1.2, Portfolio 0.1.2, Data 0.3.2 and Hyperliquid 0.3.2 after independent npm verification. These carry lessons recorded from a live autonomous trading operator: scanner labels versus verified liquidity custody, an owner address versus its reachable powers, fee tiers and quote assets as measured costs, capital on another chain as deployable through a quoted bridge, idempotent cash-flow journals and explicit candidate sizing, research queues with re-entry triggers, trader attribution rules, and receipt-verified live results for strategy validation. The other eight pins and selected-pack behavior remain unchanged.

Boomkin 0.6.0 adds token diligence through Security 0.2.0, bringing the catalog to 26 skills across 14 packs. Investigate token controls, launch flows, liquidity custody and exit evidence, then compare repeat reviews without treating lost coverage or omitted findings as resolved risks. Security includes an optional read-only snapshot collector and evidence validator; these do not sign, broadcast or establish economic safety. Existing profiles with Security selected receive both Security skills when updated.

Boomkin 0.5.1 pins Infra 0.2.1, Hyperliquid 0.3.1, Derivatives 0.1.1 and Security 0.1.1 after independent npm verification. These add CLI recovery, bot/manual-control handoffs and full-recipient verification. The [source review](https://github.com/galleonlabs/crypto-defi-skills/blob/38e58b1c9c345af0f3a61ce1d25fe33095c2003b/docs/research/minara-review.md) records attribution and validation limits. Other pack pins and selected-pack behavior remain unchanged.

The [catalog](../catalog/skills.json) records each pack's npm package, published version, full source commit, package path and expected skills. `setup` and `onboard` use the checked-out catalog; `update` fetches the current public Boomkin catalog. New pins enter that catalog after publication and verification.

Before installation, Boomkin verifies every selected source revision, package identity, version, skill metadata and path containment. Packages containing symlinks are rejected. Only the selected package paths and skill names reach the upstream installer, and temporary source checkouts are removed afterward.

`--offline-catalog` uses the checked-out catalog for `check` and `update` instead of the published one. An update still requires GitHub access to download the pinned sources.

`check` compares the last successful sync with the published catalog and always verifies the recorded file digests of the installed skills, so a pending update never hides changed files. Installed skill names and declared versions are additionally checked when no update is pending, because they are only comparable to the release you have installed. `status` lists installed skills. Neither command updates files.

## Profile files

| Path within the profile | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md` | Agent identity and instructions; existing files are preserved |
| `config.yaml`, `.env` | Native Hermes configuration and secrets |
| `skills/` | Installed skill packs and supporting files |
| `.boomkin/config.json` | Selected packs and the canonical profile/harness binding |
| `.boomkin/state/` | Upstream installer records scoped to this profile |
| `.boomkin/last-sync.json` | Catalog and provenance from the last completed installation |
| `.boomkin/operation.lock` | Prevents concurrent installations in one profile |

Keep profiles, credentials and private observations outside public repositories. Review saved paths and credentials before moving a configured profile.

## Recover an interrupted update

A failed catalog fetch or validation changes no packs. Installation is sequential: one pack may finish before another fails. Boomkin exits with an error, keeps the retry configuration and leaves the last successful sync record unchanged. Fix the reported cause and rerun the command.

A version mismatch also prevents a success record. If the sync record is incomplete, `check` reports it; a successful `setup` or `update` rebuilds it atomically.

After a hard crash, verify that no installer is running before removing `.boomkin/operation.lock`. An existing lock is not permission to interrupt another process.

For renamed skills, follow the [LP update guide](https://github.com/galleonlabs/crypto-defi-skills/tree/main/packages/lp#updates-and-migration) or [Hyperliquid update guide](https://github.com/galleonlabs/crypto-defi-skills/tree/main/packages/hyperliquid#updates-and-migration). Boomkin reports retired directories and preserves their contents for review.

## Back up and restore

Before updating, back up your profile's skills, lockfiles, instructions, Hermes configuration and `.boomkin/` records. Stop the runtime before restoring a snapshot. Treat backups containing credentials as private.

For a reproducible deployment, retain the reviewed source revisions and installed skill versions. Use the same native deployment procedure after restoring; restoring local files does not change an already running remote agent.

## Scheduled updates

Unattended instruction updates are optional. Review pack sources first, use absolute paths and explicitly select the profile in your scheduler. Monitor failures and restart Hermes during a maintenance window. Boomkin does not create a background service or restart a session automatically.

## Installed file integrity

Boomkin 0.6.1 checks each copied reference, script and asset against the reviewed source before recording success. The sync record stores installed file digests, including the harness-normalized SKILL.md. `check` and `doctor` report later missing or changed files, even when the version header still matches. These local digests diagnose installation drift; they are not signed attestations.

Older sync records remain readable. Run `update` once to establish integrity records. Before updating a modified skill, preserve your edits outside its installed directory and review them against the new release. Diagnostics do not delete or repair files automatically.
